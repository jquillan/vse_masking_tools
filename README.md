# VSE Masking Tools

Blender Addon to help with editing masks in the VSE

## Introduction

I on occasion when working in the VSE find the need to create a mask
based on the footage that is in the VSE, not a separate Movie Clip.

This plugin allows you to use the image editor to create and animate a
mask to be used in the VSE. It automatically updates the rendered
results on frame change so you always have the current frame to tweak
the mask on without manually rendering.

## Usage

 * Bring up Image Editor
 * Show **Render Results**
 * In Sidebar > View > Background Display check **Preview Sequencer**

Now you can advance frames and the image editor with show the current
frame of the VSE rendered in the Image Editor

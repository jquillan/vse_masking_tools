# VSE Masking Tools

Blender Addon to help with editing masks in the VSE

## Introduction

I on occation when working in the VSE find the need to create a mask
based on the footage that is in the VSE, not a separate Movie Clip.

This plugin allows you to use the image editor to create and animate a
mask to be used in the VSE. It automatically updates the rendered
results on frame change so you always have the current frame to tweek
the mask on with out manually rendering.

## Usage

 * Bring up Image Editor
 * Show **Render Results**
 * In the VSE Masking tab check **Sync VSE**

Now you can advance frames and the image editor with show the current
frame of the VSE rendered in the Image Editor
